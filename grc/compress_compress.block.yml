documentation: "This block provides compression based on the zstd compression library.\
    \  Compression ratios vary based on input type and data content.  Complex compress\
    \ the worst (about 10%), SC16 about 30%, BYTE the best (anywhere from 50-70% depending\
    \ on the variation in the content).  It is possible to vary both the number of\
    \ threads used as well as the requested block size to compress.  Actual block\
    \ sizes will vary around the requested block size to align with work thread actual\
    \ data.  The actual uncompressed size for a block is passed downstream as a message\
    \ attribute as it is required for decompression.  Generally it is not recommended\
    \ to adjust the block size unless you know what you are doing.  Too small a block\
    \ and the compression ratio may drop.  Too high and you may get more delay in\
    \ the flowgraph.\n  \n  The Header is an optional set of bytes prepended to the\
    \ output byte stream.  This should generally not be needed if working with the\
    \ messages as they contain the necessary metadata."
